      <h2>Body Measurement App</h2>
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        Inspired by the challenges of online shopping and finding the right fit, we developed an app
        to calculate accurate body measurements using just a smartphone.
      </p>
      <h3>What It Does</h3>
      <p>
        The app processes images taken by your smartphone camera to generate precise body measurements.
        It eliminates the need for manual measurements and expensive equipment, revolutionizing online shopping.
      </p>
      <h3>How We Built It</h3>
      <p>
        We utilized Python for backend image processing, JavaScript for the front-end interface, and machine learning
        algorithms for accurate measurement calculations. The development involved data collection, model training, and
        implementing a responsive UI.
      </p>
      <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed accurate image processing algorithms for body measurements.</li>
        <li>Created a user-friendly, responsive interface.</li>
        <li>Won 3rd place in a competitive hackathon.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <p>
        We gained valuable insights into AI implementation, image processing, and teamwork. This project enhanced
        our understanding of real-world problem-solving with technology.

    <!-- Project Details: CamGenX -->
    <section id="camgenx" style="display: none;">
      <h2>CamGenX</h2>
      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        CamGenX was inspired by the growing demand for custom content creation in the digital space. The goal was to
        provide an accessible, AI-powered tool for generating unique, context-aware images.
      </p>
      <h3>What It Does</h3>
      <p>
        CamGenX is an AI-powered image generator that creates personalized, context-specific images based on user input.
        It's designed for digital creators looking to enhance their content effortlessly.
      </p>
      <h3>How We Built It</h3>
      <p>
        We integrated pre-trained AI models with Python for backend processing and JavaScript for the user interface. 
        The development process involved implementing a seamless workflow from user input to image output.
      </p>
      <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a fully functional AI-powered image generator within a short timeframe.</li>
        <li>Designed an intuitive and engaging user interface.</li>
        <li>Won 10th place in a competitive hackathon.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project deepened our understanding of AI-powered tools, front-end and back-end integration, and collaborative
        development in a hackathon setting.
